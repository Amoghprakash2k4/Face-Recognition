Face Recognition Project
This project implements a real-time face recognition system using OpenCV and DeepFace for facial verification. It captures video from a webcam and compares detected faces with a reference image to determine if they match.

Features
Real-time face detection and recognition
Uses DeepFace for facial verification
Displays a message on the video feed indicating whether the face matches the reference image
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
OpenCV
DeepFace
Other required libraries (e.g., threading)
